# GitHub Blocks Template

This repository is based on a [starter template](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks-template) for building your own Blocks.

## Quickstart

vezwork's note: I've made it so that this repo has [Polytope](https://github.com/vezwork/Polytope/) as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). If you are cloning this repo, I believe you will have to run:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Note also that pulling will not be enough, you will also have to run `git submodule update`. Then you can run:

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # start the dev server
# Or use npm, pnpm, you know the drill
```

When you visit [localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) in your browser, you'll be
redirected to the Blocks app, but your locally-developed blocks will appear in the block picker:

(if you're using Safari (or another browser that doesn't permit calling `http` URLs from an `https` page), run `yarn start-https` and visit [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) instead.)

This template includes one example File Block and one Folder Block. The dev server supports hot reloading, so make some changes, and see what they do!

## Under the hood

Currently, Blocks are [React](https://reactjs.org/) components. They have a well-defined contract with their surroundings, and receive a [fixed set of props](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks/blob/main/docs/Developing%20blocks/4%20API%20reference%20and%20types.md) when they are instantiated. They are developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
